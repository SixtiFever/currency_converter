Currency Converter

1. DEFINING THE PROJECT
a) What is the project?
b) What is the MVP?
c) What are nice to haves?
d) When will the project be complete?

a) This is a currency converter that takes an input of GBP and converts to Dollars and vice versa
b) The MVP will involve the user starting the application, and being able to input a decimal number into a
field. The input is fixed to either GBP or USD to start. They can then enter a certain character to convert this.
An output of the equivalent currency is then given. Users can then either close the app or perform another conversion.
c) - A user interface with fields and buttons
   - Range of currencies to choose from
